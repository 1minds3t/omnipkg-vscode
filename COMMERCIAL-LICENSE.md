# omnipkg Commercial License

This commercial license is intended for companies or individuals who wish to use omnipkg
in a closed-source product, without complying with the AGPLv3 requirements.

## License Grant

By obtaining a commercial license, you are granted permission to:
 - ✅ Use omnipkg in proprietary or SaaS applications
 - ✅ Avoid the obligation to release your source code
 - ✅ Receive priority support and custom features (optional)

## How to Obtain

To inquire about commercial terms and pricing, please contact:

## Important Notes

- This commercial license does NOT affect the open-source AGPLv3 version
- The AGPLv3 version remains freely available for compliant use cases
- Commercial licenses are issued on a per-project or per-organization basis

## Why Dual Licensing?

We believe in open source, but we also recognize that some organizations
need to use omnipkg in ways that aren't compatible with AGPL-3.0. Dual
licensing allows us to:
- Keep the core project open source
- Fund continued development
- Provide enterprise-grade support
- Build a sustainable business
